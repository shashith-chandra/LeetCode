/*
Intuition
Observe the following equations that represent the relationship between the elements of the derived and original arrays:

derived[0] = original[0] XOR original[1]
derived[1] = original[1] XOR original[2]
derived[2] = original[2] XOR original[3]
derived[3] = original[3] XOR original[4]

...

derived[n-1] = original[n-1] XOR original[0]
Each element in original appears exactly twice in the equations: once as original[i] and once as original[i+1]. For example:

original[0] appears in derived[0] (original[0] XOR original[1])
original[0] also appears in derived[n-1] (original[n-1] XOR original[0])
Since XOR is both commutative and associative, the order doesn’t matter. When all occurrences of original[i] are XORed together, they cancel each other out: original[0] XOR original[0] XOR original[1] XOR original[1] ... = 0

If the derived array is valid (i.e., it was generated from some original), then the XOR of all elements in derived must be 0. This is because all elements of original cancel out when XORed.

Algorithm
Initialize a variable XOR to 0. This will store the cumulative XOR of elements in the derived array.

Iterate through each element in the derived array:

For each element, compute the XOR with the current value of XOR and update XOR.
After the loop, check the value of XOR:

If XOR == 0, return true (indicating the array is valid).
Otherwise, return false.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the size of the derived array.

Time Complexity: O(n)

The algorithm iterates through all elements of the derived array once to compute the cumulative XOR. Each XOR operation takes constant time, and the loop runs for n iterations. Thus, the time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity: O(1)

The algorithm uses a single integer variable XOR to store the cumulative XOR of elements in the array. No additional data structures are used, so the space complexity is O(1).

Approach 3: Sum Parity
Intuition
Similar to the previous approach, we can rely on the properties of XOR. However, this time, we focus on the parity (even or odd nature) of the numbers involved.

The XOR of two binary numbers produces a result based on their bits. Specifically:

0 XOR 0 = 0
1 XOR 1 = 0
0 XOR 1 = 1
1 XOR 0 = 1
Notice that when two identical numbers are XORed, the result is 0.

For an XOR operation to result in a balanced and valid sequence, the total number of 1s in the derived array (which represents mismatched bits) must be even. This is because each 1 in derived corresponds to a mismatch between adjacent elements in the original array, and mismatches can only be resolved in pairs.

The sum of the elements in derived gives the total count of 1s in the array.

If the sum is even, it means that the mismatches can be paired and resolved, allowing us to construct a valid original array.
If the sum is odd, it’s impossible to resolve the mismatches, and no valid original array can exist.
Algorithm
Initialize a variable sum to 0. This will store the cumulative sum of elements in the derived array.

Iterate through each element in the derived array:

For each element, add it's value to sum.
After the loop, check the value of sum:

If sum % 2 == 0, return true (indicating the array is valid).
Otherwise, return false.
Implementation

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the size of the derived array.

Time Complexity: O(n)

The algorithm iterates through all elements of the derived array once to compute the cumulative sum and find it's parity. Thus, the time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity: O(1)

No additional data structures are used, so the space complexity is O(1).
